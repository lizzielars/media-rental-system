# CMIS 242 - Intermediate Programming - Final Project

The purpose of Assignment 4 is to create a Java program that acts as a media rental system. 

The program displays a menu and based on the userâ€™s selection, it will load media objects from files, find a specific media object, rent a specific media object, or exit the program.

If the user does not exit the program, the menu will loop and the user will be prompted to enter another menu option.
